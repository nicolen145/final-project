Introduction to Data Science Final project 

Our project focuses on the correlation between various types of relationships and well-being of LGBTQ+ individuals over 50 in israel.
The data we used to answer our research question comes from a survey by Dr. Kuhn-Schwartz.
This survey consists of multiple-choice questions focusing on the lives of older LGBTQ individuals. The responses were compiled into a data file.
We analyzed key features related to well-being, such as relationship quality, life satisfaction, anxiety levels ,and more ,to address our research question.

Instructions on where to place the data:
