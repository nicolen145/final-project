This Markdown file describes the data folder structure and organization ...

Our project focuses on the correlation between various types of relationships and well-being of LGBTQ+ individuals over 50 in israel.
The data we used to answer our research question comes from a survey by Dr. Kuhn-Schwartz.
This survey consists of multiple-choice questions focusing on the lives of older LGBTQ individuals. The responses were compiled into a data file.
We analyzed key features related to well-being, such as relationship quality, life satisfaction, anxiety levels ,and more ,to address our research question.

*Instructions on the data:*
The data that was provided to us was in an IBM file, but we replaced it with an Excel file for easier work.
The data file "data_toshare.xlsx" should be placed in "Data" folder.
